LayoutBuilder helps you to apply advanced Auto Layout in a modern and simple way. LayoutBuilder is based on the newest Swift features and works with simple operators.

## Overview
A **LayoutBuilder** framework provides a [Layout] structure (#layoutstruct) that uses its init method with a **LayoutBuilder** Result Builder structure to catch NSLayoutConstraint collection in closure and apply them after.

A **LayoutBuilder** provides multiple operators to create **NSLayoutConstraint** in a new clear way. You can also create your own NSLayoutConstraint-s or use constraints created earlier.

## Features
- New constraint creation way, based on operators.
- Based on a new Swift feature called Result Builder (ex Function Builder).
- Allowed to use conditional statements inside **Layout** body to create flexible constraint scenario.

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+ / Mac OS X 10.10+
- Xcode 12.5+
- Swift 5.4+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](#https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:
```
$ gem install cocoapods
```
To integrate **LayoutBuilder** into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:
```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'LayoutBuilder'
end
```
Then, run the following command:
```
$ pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

> Xcode 12.5+ is required to build LayoutBuilder using Swift Package Manager.

To integrate SnapKit into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/multimediasuite/LayoutBuilder.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.5.1"))
]
```

Or add dependency manually in Xcode. File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency... then enter the package URL 'https://github.com/multimediasuite/LayoutBuilder.git' and click Next button.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate **LayoutBuilder** into your project manually.

## Explanation

### Description

I was inspired by the [Auto Layout Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AnatomyofaConstraint.html) to create a new operator-based way to create NSLayoutConstraint that will match the primary **LayoutBuilder** idea.

![](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Art/view_formula_2x.png)

So, full construction of operator-based constraint creation is 
````
(leftSideView.layout(<NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute>) == multiplier * rightSideView.layout(<NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute>) + constant) ! UILayoutPriority
````
UIView was extended with `layout(_ attribute:)` method, where attribute is NSLayoutConstraint.Attribute.
Call `view.layout(.attributeName)` for each side of layout creation operators.

There are multiple operators created for NSLayoutConstraint creation.
| Operator | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `==` | EQUAL relation operator. Use `==` after call `layout(_ attribute:)` method in the first view |
| `>=` | GREATER THAN OR EQUAL relation operator. Use `==` after call `layout(_ attribute:)` method in the first view |
| `<=` | LESS THAN OR EQUAL relation operator. Use `==` after call `layout(_ attribute:)` method in the first view |
| `+` | Operator to add constant to relation. Use after you call `layout(_ attribute:)` method in the second view |
| `-` | Operator to add inversed constant to relation. Use after you call `layout(_ attribute:)` method in the second view |
| `*` | Operator to add multiplier to relation. Use before you call `layout(_ attribute:)` method in the second view |
| `!` | Operator to add priority to the constraint. Use after your constraint vas created |

Call `Layout` initializer to apply constraints. Layout initializer's single parameter is a closure that uses Result Builder **LayoutBuilder** to accept multiple NSLayoutConstraints parameters.

### Examples

1. Create redView and blueView properties and add them as subviews to the parent view
````swift
let redView = UIView()
redView.backgroundColor = .red
        
let blueView = UIView()
blueView.backgroundColor = .blue
        
view.addSubview(redView)
view.addSubview(blueView)
````
2. Create constraints
````swift
//1
let topConstraint = redView.layout(.top) == view.layout(.centerY) + 50 
//2
let leadingConstraint = redView.layout(.leading) == 20
//3
let centerXConstraint = (redView.layout(.centerX) == 1/2 * view.layout(.centerX) + 10) ! .defaultLow
//4
let heightConstraint = redView.layout(.height) >= 33
````
So, we created 4 constraints. Top Constraint (1) was created using the relation between two views and adding constant to this relation. Leading Constraint (2) was created using the relation berween view and constant. Such an entry means that Red View automatically applies relation to its superview and adds constant. Center X Constraint (3) was created using the relation between two views, multiplier, constant, and priority. Height Constraint (4) was created using greaterThanOrEqual relation between view and constant. 

3. Apply constraints 
````swift
Layout {
    topConstraint
    leadingConstraint
    centerXConstraint
    heightConstraint
}
````

Also you can create constraints directly inside Layout body
````swift
Layout {
    redView.layout(.top) == view.layout(.centerY) + 50
    redView.layout(.leading) == 20
    (redView.layout(.centerX) == 1/2 * view.layout(.centerX) + 10) ! .defaultLow
    redView.layout(.height) >= 33
}
````

And finaly, you can create and use properties inside Layout body
````swift
Layout {
    redView.layout(.top) == view.layout(.centerY) + 50
    redView.layout(.leading) == 20
    (redView.layout(.centerX) == 1/2 * view.layout(.centerX) + 10) ! .defaultLow
            
    let heightConstraint = redView.layout(.height) >= 33            
    heightConstraint
}
````

4. Using conditional statements inside Layout body
````
Layout {
    if needTopConstraint {
        redView.layout(.top) == view.layout(.centerY) + 50
    } else {
        redView.layout(.centerY) == view.layout(.centerY)
    }
            
    redView.layout(.leading) == 20
            
    if let blueView = blueView {
        blueView.layout(.leading) == 20
    }
}
````
You can use conditional statements and optional chaining inside Layout body. It provides a really flexible way to constraint building.
